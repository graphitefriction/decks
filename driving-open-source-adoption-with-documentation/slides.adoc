We're going to compare the content on the home pages and portions of a tutorial for two projects: Cassandra and Docker.

Cassandra because I know lots of you in DOSUG are Cassandra users.
Docker because I've heard a lot of good things about their tutorials.

_My company doesn't have a partnership with either of these projects._

*IMPORTANT*

As we walk through the content presented on these slides, let me reiterate:

. No one's documentation is perfect
. I've committed every one of the documentation sins I'll point out and will commit them again.
. Documentation is a continuing process.
. Documentation is never done.
. Documentation can always be improved.
. Some documentation is better than no documentation.
. Pick one problem or one document and work on improving that content vs. trying to tackle all of your documentation.

*Cassandra homepage top*

* Messaging hierarchy: The headline on your homepage is your 1 second to tell the reader if they've discover content that will help them solve their problem.
** _Welcome to Apache Cassandra_ How does this #1 message on the Cassandra page help me get oriented? Help me know what Cassandra can do to help me? This is wasted home page real estate and it wastes the users' time. A community/project can't say it's welcoming, it can only show people it is welcoming--through IRC, forums, events--not through headlines.
* _Opening paragraph_ So...what kind of database is Cassandra? graph? relational? Telling me it has scalability, etc. doesn't mean anything to me if I'm not yet sure if it's the type of database I need.
** _Cassandra support..._ Support--as in people? Does it require a service contract?
** _Video & Slides tabs_ Generic titles that don't compel me in anyway to click on them except that I'm still trying to figure out what kind of database Cassandra is.

*Cassandra homepage, overview section*

* Laying out 3-4 key benefits is an excellent way to let users get a quick snapshot of how Cassandra can help them.
** 8 key benefits is a few too many, by the time I get to the last benefit, I've forgotten the first one
//^

_Your users are busy, tired, and have a manager breathing down their neck, all of which means their memory is shot to hell._

* Don't make them read a dissertation.
* Don't info dump.
* Your content should not be the scene of a digital scavenger hunt.

*Cassandra homepage, overview section*

* _Proven_ This section is important, people like to see that a project is already helping other people.
However, it's readability is poor because it has all those links. These two paragraphs would work better as their own section (on par with _Overview_).
* _Fault tolerant, decentralized, durable_ I don't see any difference between what these 3 key points are telling me about Cassandra.
* _You're in control_ Of course I'm in control, it's my life after all. These are throw-away words. Instead, what's the awesome benefit Cassandra let's me control.

*Cassandra homepage, learn more section*

* It's very important to point users to related resources, places where they can get help, and the next steps they should take, so this section is excellent in the regard.
** _On the web_ I'd throw away this title, we're on the web, there's no reason to waste these words. Also, why is the list numbered? Is the wiki the least important thing?
* _Copyright 2009_ *DANGER* Now I'm really worried. Is that the last time this information was updated? Is this project dead?
// ^

The little stuff matters. The lapsed copyright combined with the age of the slidedeck really makes me hesitate.
This project could be dead or poorly maintained. _Why should I research it any further?_

*Cassandra getting started wiki page, top*

* The getting started link on the homepage leads me to a wiki page (2nd portal). The very different look and feel (aged) of this page versus the homepage makes me wonder about the maturity and maintenance of the project.
* _Documentation from DataStax_ This is the first message on the wikipage, only adding to my hesitancy and confusion. What is DataStax? Does Apache no longer support this project? Do I need to get DataStax to get Cassandra? Does Cassandra not work without DataStax? I'm now concerned that the wiki documentation isn't up-to-date/any good and that Cassandra is just a website funneling me to a company/service.
* _Trying Cassandra in a VM_ Yes! Get users trying your project as soon as possible. This also tells me what type of people might be helped by Cassandra.

*Cassandra getting started wiki page, Step 0*

* _Cassandra requires the most stable version of Java 7 you can deploy, preferably the Oracle/Sun JVM._ *The most stable version of Java 7*. So Cassandra is delicate? How the _heck_ do I determine what the writers of Cassandra consider *most stable*? How do I figure out which stable version to use? What if I can't use Java 7 - have I just wasted all my time reading the homepage and getting to this point?
** _Oracle/Sun JVM_ And the link sends me to the Java 8 download page. So where's Java 7? or can I use Java 8? I'm getting more confused and would definitely be searching for Cassandra alternatives at this point.

*Planet Cassandra Intro to 10 min tut pages*

* Planet Cassandra is the 3rd portal we encounter while learning Cassandra. So just who is the owner/knowledge keeper of Cassandra? How are Cassandra, the wiki, Planet Cassandra, and DataStax all related? Where am I supposed to really be going to get the best Cassandra information?
* _Apache Cassandra has become the leading NoSQL platform_ And we've finally learned that Cassandra is a NoSQL database!
* _10 Minute Cassandra Walkthrough_ Yes! Tell readers the time something should take.

. Introduce the main characters by their full and proper names (no slang/jargon/lingo)
. Define terms, never assume
. Concisely describe the environment (i.e. get them oriented)
. The arc
. The conclusion
. The next goal/stage

. What are the 1-3 things that will learn or achieve when they complete this tutorial?
.. Be specific!
. Are there prerequisites?
.. List previous tutorials/lessons that should be completed.
. Are there dependencies?
.. Dependencies should be part of the tutorial and/or part of the things they will achieve in completing the tutorials.
. What type of example will illustrate each step. (code, console, text, screenshot, video, audio, figure, illustration, etc.)
. What would that example include (input, output, elements from previous tutorials, new materials that need to be introduced, etc.)
. What content is needed to support the examples?
. What resources should the tutorial link to?
. What is the next step for the user once they've completed the tutorial?

Clearly define each part of an example, I call these anatomy examples.

Why? Because, at least in the technology sector, words such as type, component, module, style, option, context, attribute, value, key, element, name, tag, etc. are overloaded with ambiguous meanings, misunderstands, and disagreement.

Therefore, saying: _Assign the optional values to the options list_ can have different meanings for users depending on their background.

== Explicit

----
<1> Mark lead-in text explaining the context or setting of the quote using a period. (optional)
<2> For content that doesn’t require the preservation of line breaks, set quote in the first position of the attribute list.
<3> The second position contains who the excerpt is attributed to. (optional)
<4> Enter additional citation information in the third position. (optional)
<5> Enter the excerpt or quote text on the line immediately following the attribute list.
