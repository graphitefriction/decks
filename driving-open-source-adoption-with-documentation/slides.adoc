. Evaluate just how big the documentation and the documentation project objectives are
. Meet the people who will interact with the documentation and use the documentation
. Make a plan for the documentation
.. Brainstorm, set, and prioritize the goals
.. Tactics for outlining each goal per audience
. Examples
.. Make them useful, correct, and not boring
. Outline the supporting content

I consider documentation any content you create.
All of the content you create must help the user achieve their goals/solve their problems.

. What will help the users who have this problem solve it?
.. New users: basic component tutorials, getting oriented tutorials, how-to use the tools tutorials
.. Intermediate users: more advanced tutorials, user manual, case studies, tips and tricks
. What will help the people who can help solve this problem to share their knowledge?
.. New developers: basic code overview, glossaries, contributor guide, API docs

== Writing a Tutorial

[.speaker]

.General outline
. Plot each goal like a screenwriter (or a mad scientist {dots})
. Be brutal and slash the backstory/history/personal commentary
. Get right into the action
. Show, don't tell
. Introduce the main characters by their full and proper names (no slang/jargon/lingo)
. Define terms, never assume
. Concisely describe the environment (i.e. get them oriented)
. The arc
. The conclusion
. The next goal/stage
--

== !

[.speaker]
--
.Tutorial outline
. What are the 1-3 things that will learn or achieve when they complete this tutorial?
.. Be specific!
. Are there prerequisites?
.. List previous tutorials/lessons that should be completed.
. Are there dependencies?
.. Dependencies should be part of the tutorial and/or part of the things they will achieve in completing the tutorials.
. What type of example will illustrate each step. (code, console, text, screenshot, video, audio, figure, illustration, etc.)
. What would that example include (input, output, elements from previous tutorials, new materials that need to be introduced, etc.)
. What content is needed to support the examples?
. What resources should the tutorial link to?
. What is the next step for the user once they've completed the tutorial?

Example Types

[.incremental.dense]
* Anatomy
* Explicit
* Boring
* Real

ifdef::notes[]

[.speaker]

For tutorials, creating the examples first is one tactic for keeping the tutorial concise and on target.

== Anatomy

[.source]
== Anatomy of a basic block quote

[source,asciidoc]
----
[quote, attribution, citation title and information]
Quote or excerpt text

ifdef::notes[]

[.speaker]
--
Clearly define each part of an example, I call these anatomy examples.

Why? Because, at least in the technology sector, words such as type, component, module, style, option, context, attribute, value, key, element, name, tag, etc. are overloaded with ambiguous meanings, misunderstands, and disagreement.

Therefore, saying: ``Assign the optional values to the options list'' can have different meanings for users depending on their background.

== Explicit

[.source]
== Block quote example

[source,asciidoc]
----
.After landing the cloaked Klingon bird of prey in Golden Gate park: <1>
[quote, Captain James T. Kirk, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home] <2> <3> <4>
Everybody remember where we parked. <5>
----
<1> Mark lead-in text explaining the context or setting of the quote using a period. (optional)
<2> For content that doesnâ€™t require the preservation of line breaks, set quote in the first position of the attribute list.
<3> The second position contains who the excerpt is attributed to. (optional)
<4> Enter additional citation information in the third position. (optional)
<5> Enter the excerpt or quote text on the line immediately following the attribute list.

After anatomy examples, I like to include basic examples that are explicitly labeled with callouts.

== The _Boring_ Factor

[.source]
== Apostrophe example

[source,asciidoc]
----
Olaf's desk overflowed with heaps of paper, apple cores and squeaky toys.
We couldn't find his keyboard.
The state of his desk was replicated, sometimes in triplicate, across all of the werewolves' desks.

Users may skim over/not pay attention to examples that follow the same form/function of examples that were created 10 years ago and/or have become a cliche in your industry.

endif::[]

== The _Reality_ Factor

[.statement]
== !

No one sets up such a basic project.

[.statement]
== !

No one uses all those options in the same argument at the same time.

[.speaker]

Instead, use examples you learned from your users when you met with them.
This also engages and thanks the community.

.Help users remember what they learned.

ifdef::notes[]
[.speaker]
One way to help users remember what they just learned is to include short quizzes or exercises.

== The Next Step

[.statement]
== !

If you don't point your users toward the next lesson and related resources, it's like _abandoning them on Everest without shoes or shorts_.
