<ul><li>Messaging hierarchy: The headline on your homepage is your 1 second to tell the reader if they&#8217;ve discover content that will help them solve their problem.<ul><li><em>Welcome to Apache Cassandra</em> How does this #1 message on the Cassandra page help me get oriented? Help me know what Cassandra can do to help me? This is wasted home page real estate and it wastes the users' time. A community/project can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s welcoming, it can only show people it is welcoming&#8212;through IRC, forums, events&#8212;not through headlines.</li></ul></li><li><em>Opening paragraph</em> So&#8230;what kind of database is Cassandra? graph? relational?

<section><div class="openblock speaker"><div class="title">Speaker notes</div><p><strong>Cassandra homepage, overview section</strong></p>
<ul><li>Laying out 3-4 key benefits is an excellent way to let users get a quick snapshot of how Cassandra can help them.<ul><li>8 key benefits is a few too many, by the time I get to the last benefit, I&#8217;ve forgotten the first one</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><em>Your users are busy, tired, and have a manager breathing down their neck, all of which means their memory is shot to hell.</em></p>

<section><div class="openblock speaker"><div class="title">Speaker notes</div><p><strong>Cassandra homepage, overview section</strong></p>
<ul><li><em>Proven</em> This section is important, people like to see that a project is already helping other people.
However, it&#8217;s readability is poor because it has all those links. These two paragraphs would work better as their own section (on par with <em>Overview</em>).</li><li><em>Fault tolerant, decentralized, durable</em> I don&#8217;t see any difference between what these 3 key points are telling me about Cassandra.</li><li><em>You&#8217;re in control</em> Of course I&#8217;m in control, it&#8217;s my life after all. These are throw-away words. Instead, what&#8217;s the awesome benefit Cassandra let&#8217;s me control.</li></ul></div></section>

<section><div class="openblock speaker"><div class="title">Speaker notes</div><p><strong>Cassandra homepage, learn more section</strong></p>
<ul><li>It&#8217;s very important to point users to related resources, places where they can get help, and the next steps they should take, so this section is excellent in the regard.<ul><li><em>On the web</em> I&#8217;d throw away this title, we&#8217;re on the web, there&#8217;s no reason to waste these words. Also, why is the list numbered? Is the wiki the least important thing?</li></ul></li><li><em>Copyright 2009</em> <strong>DANGER</strong> Now I&#8217;m really worried. Is that the last time this information was updated? Is this project dead?</li></ul>
<p>The little stuff matters. The lapsed copyright combined with the age of the slidedeck really makes me hesitate.
This project could be dead or poorly maintained. <em>Why should I research it any further?</em></p></div></section>

<section><div class="openblock speaker"><div class="title">Speaker notes</div><p><strong>Cassandra getting started wiki page, top</strong></p>
<ul><li>The getting started link on the homepage leads me to a wiki page (2nd portal). The very different look and feel (aged) of this page versus the homepage makes me wonder about the maturity and maintenance of the project.</li><li><em>Documentation from DataStax</em> This is the first message on the wikipage, only adding to my hesitancy and confusion. What is DataStax? Does Apache no longer support this project? Do I need to get DataStax to get Cassandra? Does Cassandra not work without DataStax? I&#8217;m now concerned that the wiki documentation isn&#8217;t up-to-date/any good and that Cassandra is just a website funneling me to a company/service.</li><li><em>Trying Cassandra in a VM</em> Yes! Get users trying your project as soon as possible. This also tells me what type of people might be helped by Cassandra.</li></ul></div></section>
<section><div class="openblock speaker"><div class="title">Speaker notes</div><p><strong>Cassandra getting started wiki page, Step 0</strong></p>
<ul><li><em>Cassandra requires the most stable version of Java 7 you can deploy, preferably the Oracle/Sun JVM.</em> <strong>The most stable version of Java 7</strong>. So Cassandra is delicate? How the <em>heck</em> do I determine what the writers of Cassandra consider <strong>most stable</strong>? How do I figure out which stable version to use? What if I can&#8217;t use Java 7 - have I just wasted all my time reading the homepage and getting to this point?<ul><li><em>Oracle/Sun JVM</em> And the link sends me to the Java 8 download page. So where&#8217;s Java 7? or can I use Java 8? I&#8217;m getting more confused and would definitely be searching for Cassandra alternatives at this point.</li></ul></li></ul></div></section>
