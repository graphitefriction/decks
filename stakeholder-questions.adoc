. Identify all of the organization's stakeholders
. Ask them any applicable questions regarding the content's life cycle

These are just a few of the individuals/teams who may take part in the content life cycle and who should be communicated with during the planning and development of the project's content.

* Writers, creators (text, audio, video, etc.)
* IA

* Metadata, SEO, and analytics
* Database
* Publishers (general and for specific channels)
* Owners
* Business strategists
* Brand, messaging, and marketing
* Community managers
* Public relations

* Reviewers, editors, approvers

== Stakeholder Questions

These are some of the general questions I ask the stakeholders involved in a content project.

* Why do you want to create this content?
* What messages/objectives will this content support?
* How do you create content (i.e. the content process/life cycle within the organization)?
* Who will care about this content (internally and externally)?

* How do you know they want this content?
* Who/what influences your users?

* Brand values and strategy
* Messaging strategy and hierachy
* Previous content strategies
